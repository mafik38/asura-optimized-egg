# Mafpogi's optimised egg

Startup message to fully optimise your Paper/Purpur server. I tested it on my own 1.20.6 server. Usage was 777MB of Memory and 5.6% of Processor. Also, for better perfomance use OpenJ9 Java docker images. You can find it for pterodactyl panel on yolks or softwarenoob githubs. https://github.com/pterodactyl/yolks & https://github.com/Software-Noob/pterodactyl-images

`curl -Os https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mafik38/mafoptimisedegg/main/start.sh && bash start.sh` - the startup command
